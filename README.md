# Pack-In-eZ

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
  * Weather based clothing forecast: We require the users to feed in your travel dates, city you are traveling to, age, gender and flight details. Once we have these inputs, the program will open to a 5 day weather forecast  in the city you are traveling to and suggest appropriate clothing for when they arrive. 
  * Packing list: There is also a ready clothing list available for Men, Women, Children, A toiletry list and a list for essentials. This can be used regardless of the weather condition and can be customized to one’s needs. 
  * Flight information: Using your flight inputs we show you the baggage allowance for your airlines. This would help you to plan your luggage well and avoid paying for more baggage allowance. 
 * Reduce stress: The ultimatum of this web based application is to help reduce travel stress, primarily for ‘Packing’.
